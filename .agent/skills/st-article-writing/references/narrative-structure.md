# Narrative Structure for ST Articles

Use this structure when writing paper explainers aimed at high completion and high understanding.

## 1) Front-loaded lead (first 1-2 lines)
- Start with the conclusion: what changed and why it matters.
- Do not start with background or personal preface.
- Keep one unresolved detail to preserve curiosity.

## 2) Curiosity hook (within first 3-5 lines)
- Add a concrete risk, paradox, or "common belief that fails."
- Make the reader care by stating the cost of being wrong.
- Name the focal paper immediately.

## 3) Reader promise (3 bullets max)
- State what the reader can explain after reading.
- Keep promises concrete and testable.

## 4) Inverted pyramid body
Write in this order:
1. Most important finding first
2. Supporting evidence and method
3. Background and context (bonus)

Do not bury the key finding in later sections.

## 5) Method and evidence block
- Explain design in three sub-blocks:
  - Data construction/sampling
  - Task/protocol
  - Metrics/evaluation axes
- Keep technical terms exact, but explain each in plain Japanese once.
- If the term is hard, add a short parenthetical gloss at first mention.

## 6) Findings block (2-4 points)
For each finding, write:
- What changed
- Under which condition
- Why it matters in practice

## 7) Limits and skepticism
- Add at least 2 limitations.
- Explicitly separate:
  - What is supported by evidence
  - What is still uncertain

## 8) Practical checklist
- Provide 4-6 checks that can be applied this week.
- Use checkbox format.

## 9) Closing summary with application examples
- End with one core sentence.
- Add 3-5 application examples tied to concrete decisions.
