# Fact Integrity Checklist

Run this checklist before publishing.

## Source Quality
- Confirm the focal paper URL is arXiv abs URL (`https://arxiv.org/abs/...`).
- Confirm publication date is explicit and absolute (YYYY-MM-DD).
- Avoid tertiary summaries as the main source.

## Claim Hygiene
- Tie each numeric claim to a source sentence or table.
- Replace unsupported numbers with qualitative phrasing.
- Mark interpretation explicitly as interpretation.

## Scope Control
- Avoid generalizing beyond the benchmark/task scope.
- State domain limits (dataset, setup, evaluation constraints).
- Separate observed result from deployment recommendation.

## Language Quality
- Remove hype terms that imply certainty without evidence.
- Prefer specific terms over vague praise.
- Keep sentences short in the intro and transitions.

## Required Sections
