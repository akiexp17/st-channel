**Summary:** The SCALAR benchmark evaluates how well materials foundation models generalize across geometric scales, from unit cells to large supercells. The study reveals that while explicit reasoning (Chain-of-Thought) can reduce hallucinations, it often destabilizes consistency and output validity. This highlights that model accuracy does not necessarily imply robust scale generalization in materials science tasks.
