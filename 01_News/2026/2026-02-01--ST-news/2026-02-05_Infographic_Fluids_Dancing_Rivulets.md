**Summary:** This study investigates the nonlinear response of a thin fluid filament (rivulet) in a Hele-Shaw cell when subjected to acoustic forcing. The researchers found that a three-wave resonant interaction leads to instability, characterized by a specific pattern wavelength determined by the resonance condition. The "dancing" behavior is explained by a model based on depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations.
