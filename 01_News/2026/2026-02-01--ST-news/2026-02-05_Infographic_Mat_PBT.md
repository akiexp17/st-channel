**Summary:** PBT is the first Foundation Model designed for battery cycle life prediction. Trained on diverse lithium-ion battery datasets using a mixture-of-experts architecture, it achieves state-of-the-art performance (19.8%  improvement) and demonstrates successful transfer learning to sodium-ion and zinc-ion batteries, paving the way for universal battery lifetime prediction.
