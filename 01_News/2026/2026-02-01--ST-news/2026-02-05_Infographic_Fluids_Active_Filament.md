**Summary:** This numerical study examines fluid transport driven by a single beating filament (modeling a cilium) in a 3D two-phase flow, relevant to mucociliary clearance. Using Lattice Boltzmann simulations coupled with the Immersed Boundary Method, the authors found that moderate periciliary layer (PCL) thickness and high filament stiffness maximize transport efficiency. Two competing mechanisms, drag-elastic force balance and viscous diffusion of momentum, drive the process.
