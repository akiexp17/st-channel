**Summary:** ChemCRAFT is a new framework that empowers small, locally deployable language models to perform complex chemical reasoning by decoupling reasoning from knowledge storage. Using agentic reinforcement learning and a chemical sandbox, the model learns to use tools for information retrieval and manipulation. This approach outperforms large cloud-based LLMs in drug design tasks while ensuring privacy and reducing costs.
